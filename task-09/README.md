# Feedback :
- Although this task seemed vast to me, I had some experience working in flask as I had previously built
a cloned website that fetched recipes as part of a club selection process.

# Features implemented :
- Login
- Registration
- Track (not working properly)
- Watchlist
- Profile
- Used a database (PostgreSQL) for storing the user info and watchlists etc.

# Usage :
- clone the dreamteam-tasks repo, copy the task-09 content (server), setup env and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aakashchoudhary24/dreamteam-tasks.git
```
Making a makeshift directory
```
mkdir cineverse
```
```
cp -r /path/to/dreamteam-tasks/task-09/ /path/to/cineverse/
```
```
cd /path/to/cineverse/task-09/ && pip3 install requirements.txt
```
```
flask run 
```
