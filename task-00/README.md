- I have already been using ubuntu for an year now
so this task was already done for me. 
- Regarding the usage of linux, in my opinion it is the best OS a programmer
can use. I wish I started working with such systems earlier because working via the terminal,
solving your own problems via
the community, customizing your pc/OS is something
that ignites curiosity and interest in this field, which helped me too.
- In my opinion this task is the foundation every computer science
student should go through and using linux in general makes you a good reader and
optimizes your google searches
