# Feedback : 
- This task was pretty challenging for me since this was my first time building such a website that has several pages, is responsive and uses a ton of javascript. 
- I have worked on a react based site earlier for my S-2 subject evaluation, but that site just had a navbar and login, register, that too without any backend and functionality, so this task was pretty huge for me. 
- All in all a great learning experience, and I am very confident now that I can build actual websites along with functionalities and not just static data.


# Usage : 
- Clone the dreamteam repo to your local system via : 
``` git clone https://github.com/Aakashchoudhary24/dreamteam-tasks.git 
```
- Create a makeshift directory to store the client side logic and copy files to that dir :
``` mkdir cineverse cp -r /path/to/the/dreamteam-tasks/task-08/ /path/to/your/cineverse/repo/ 
``` 
The above command will successfully copy the client directory to your cineverse project, now to see the frontend : 
``` cd /path/to/your/cineverse/client/ 
``` 
``` npm install ``` 
``` npm run dev ```
